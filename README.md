## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- gained a better understanding of how to use the position attributes relative and absolute

- learned how to center an image on top of another, CSS code I'm proud of:
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

- learned how to hide an image and display it when the mouse hovers over it, CSS code I'm proud of:

```css
.img-view {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

```css
.img-section:hover .img-view {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I continue to improve my knwoledge of using CSS Grid.
